## Getting Started


## Widget Reference
### Arithmetic widgets

- add_constant
- subtract_constant
- multiply_constant
- divide_constant

Interpretation:  
"Look at every value and {add to it/subtract from it/multiply it by/divide it by} {constant}."

Columns:  
These widgets must take columns that are numeric. If the entries have any characters that are non-numeric, I recommend cleaning them out with the remove_characters widget first.

Inputs:  
*constant*: The number to add/subtract/multiply/divide with every number in the column


### Numeric replacement widgets

#### Open range replacement
- replace_less_equal
- replace_less_than
- replace_greater_equal
- replace_greater_than

Interpretation:  
"Replace values {less than/greater than/less than or equal to/greater than or equal to} {threshold} with {value}."

Columns:  
These widgets must take columns that are numeric. If the entries have any characters that are non-numeric, I recommend cleaning them out with the remove_characters widget first.

Inputs:  
*threshold*: The boundary beyond which the replacement will take place. It functions as expected, like   
*value*: The number which will replace each entry selected by the comparison above.

#### Single value replacement
- replace_equal

Interpretation:  
"Replace values equal to {target} with {value}."

Columns:  
Same as above.

Inputs:  
*target*: The number that will be replaced within the data.  

#### Closed range replacement
- replace_in_range

Interpretation:  
"Replace values within the range {lower} to {upper} (inclusive) with {value}."

Columns:  
Same as above.

Inputs:  
*upper*: The top bound where the replacement will happen. It is inclusive, so instances of this value within the data column will be replaced.  
*lower*: The lower bound where the replacement will happen. It is inclusive, so instances of this value within the data column will be replaced.  
*value*: Same as others.

#### Rounding
- rounding

Interpretation:  
"Round all values in a specific way."

Columns:  
One or more numeric columns.

Inputs:  
*mode*: May be 'up', 'down', 'truncate', or 'nearest'. If it is 'up', rounds all values to the next highest integer, towards +inf. If it is 'down', rounds to the next lowest integer, towards -inf. If it is 'truncate', takes off the decimal part, rounding towards 0. If it is 'nearest', round to the nearest integer.  
*precision*: If an integer precision is given, instead round to that many digits beyond the decimal point.


### Statistical widgets

#### Probability density function
- pdf

Interpretation:  
"Calculate a numerical probability density function from the data."

Columns:  
Any numeric data. If the entries have any characters that are non-numeric, I recommend cleaning them out with the remove_characters widget first.

Inputs:  
*bins*: The number of bins for values to be sorted into. It should be an integer, but if it isn't, it will be truncated down.  
*minmax*: Can be 'auto' or 'manual'. If it is 'auto', the range captured by the distribution will be the entire range of the data. If 'manual', it will instead use the range defined by the *lower* and *upper* inputs.  
*lower*: Only used when *minmax* is 'manual'. The lower bound on a user-defined range.  
*upper*: Only used when *minmax* is 'manual'. The upper bound on a user-defined range.  
*outliers*: May be 'exclude' or 'include'. If it is 'exclude', values that fall outside the range of the distribution will be ignored. If it is 'include', these values will be sorted into the tail bins.  
*norm*: May be 'raw' or 'probability'. If it is 'raw', returns the number of values that fall in each bin. If 'probability', returns the proportion of values that fall in each bin.

#### General statistics
- statistics

Interpretation:  
"Calculate some general statistics of the data."

Columns:  
Any numeric data. If the entries have any characters that are non-numeric, I recommend cleaning them out with the remove_characters widget first.


Inputs:  
None.


### Data integrity verification

- check_int

Interpretation:  
"Check whether every value in the data is an integer."

Columns:  
Any numeric data. If the entries have any characters that are non-numeric, I recommend cleaning them out with the remove_characters widget first.

Inputs:  
None.


### Data existence verification

- count_records

Interpretation:  
"Count how many complete records (those that contain no missing entries) there are."

Columns:  
Any. The primary use cases will likely either be to inspect a particular column for missing values, or to examine all the columns at once to look for any type of missing data.

Inputs:  
None.


### Data characterization

- count_distinct

Interpretation:  
"Count the number of distinct values within a column."

Columns:  
A single column of any type of data.

Inputs:  
None.


- count_corresponding

Interpretation:  
"Count the number of different values in column B that are paired with each different value in column A."

Columns:  
Two of any type.

Inputs:  
None.


### Date manipulation

- reformat_dates_to_gtnp

Interpretation:  
"Reformat a date given into the GTN-P standard format."

Columns:  
A column of date information.

Inputs:  
*format*: A description of the current format of the date information, using [Python's *strptime* specification](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior). An abbreviated version of the table given at the link is below. Note that if characters other than date information appear in the column, they need to be included in the format. For instance, the correct format string corresponding to the date 'Y1998M07D24' (representing July 24, 1998) is 'Y%YM%mD%d'. This way the program will read only the relevant information.
